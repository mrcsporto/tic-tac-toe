#A SIMPLE TIC-TAC-TOE GAME IN JAVASCRIPT

##(1) Grid layout

The game grid is represented in the array Grid.cells as follows:

[0] [1] [2]
[3] [4] [5]
[6] [7] [8]

The cells (array elements) hold the following numeric values:
0 if not occupied, 1 for player, 3 for computer.
This allows us to quickly get an overview of the game state:
if the sum of all the cells in a row is 9, the computer wins,
if it is 3 and all the cells are occupied, the human player wins,
etc.
